/**
 * Problem:
 * given a set of match sticks which are arranged in a rectangle
 * (think of it as each entry in the matrix represents a match).
 * 
 * Now, match at (0,0) is lit up.
 * Rules:
 * - if a match is lit up, it takes 1 second for it to be lighted and
 * after 1 second it can light up its neighbours(no diagnol).
 * 
 * Ask:
 * - after how much time will all the matches be lit
 * - complexity?
 * 
 * Solution:
 * pending
